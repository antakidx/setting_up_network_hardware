The following code/steps was the same for enabling wifi for all Ubuntu versions

sudo apt update
sudo apt install network-manager
sudo apt install net-tools
sudo ls /sys/class/net (used to identify the name of wireless network interface, mine was wlp2s0, always look for a w)
sudo ls /etc/netplan (used to find the correct netplan configuration file, mine was 01-network-manager-all.yaml)
sudo vi /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml 	refer to following link to see what to add in the config file -> https://linuxconfig.org/ubuntu-22-04-connect-to-wifi-from-command-line
sudo netplan apply
disconnect ethernet (make sure only wifi card is running by using nmcli d command)
sudo ip a
wifi will now display
ping 8.8.8.8 to test wifi
