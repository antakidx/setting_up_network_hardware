Ubuntu Server All Versions
***Steps/code used to set up LTE***


Ubuntu Server 18.04
======================
Install 18.04 server
sudo apt update
sudo apt install net-tools
sudo apt install network-manager
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl start network-manager
sudo systemctl enable network-manager
sudo reboot now

sudo ls /etc/netplan
sudo vi /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
For each ethernet listed, add "optional: true" below each "dhcp4: true" line.
Beneath version number line, add "renderer: NetworkManager".
Save changes and exit .yaml file.
sudo netplan apply
sudo reboot now

sudo nmcli d
Ethernet should now be connected, test with ping 8.8.8.8
sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved
sudo reboot now

sudo apt install libqmi-utils
sudo apt install udhcpc
sudo nmcli d (check the device name for the running ethernet connection, mine was enp2s0 for example; from this step on wherever you see enp2s0, replace with your device name))
sudo ip link set dev enp2s0 up
sudo dhclient enp2s0
sudo reboot now

sudo nmcli d (check for device name of LTE card, mine was named cdc-wdm2 for example, look for cdc- or a name that starts with w)
sudo qmicli --device=/dev/cdc-wdm2 --device-open-proxy --get-wwan-iface (remember whatever the listed name is, mine was wwan0 for example)
The most recent Qualcomm based cellular modules only expose QMI interfaces that can support Raw-IP mode. Sierra Wireless EM/MC74 and EM75 series modules, Telit LM940 and LN940 series for example require this.
Check what IP-mode the host system is configured for:
qmicli --device=/dev/cdc-wdm2 --get-expected-data-format
Check what IP-mode the cellular module require:
qmicli --device=/dev/cdc-wdm2 --device-open-proxy --wda-get-data-format

If Raw-IP is not set by default, do the following:
to change qmi_wwan driver to use Raw-IP:
Disable the network interfaces exposed by the cellular module:
ip link set dev wwan0 down
Trigger the Raw-IP support:
echo Y > /sys/class/net/wwan0/qmi/raw_ip
Enable the network interfaces again:
ip link set dev wwan0 up

sudo vi /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
Edit your .yaml file so that it looks like this (with your device names placed accordingly, everything listed below is how my .yaml file looked, you need to add all the modem info you see below):

network:
  ethernets:
    enp1s0:
      dhcp4: true
      optional: true
    enp2s0:
      dhcp4: true
      optional: true
    enp3s0:
      dhcp4: true
      optional: true
  version: 2
  renderer: NetworkManager
  modems:
    cdc-wdm2:
      apn: Wbdata
      dhcp4: true
      optional: true

Save changes and exit .yaml file.
sudo netplan apply
sudo reboot now

sudo qmicli --device=/dev/cdc-wdm2 --device-open-proxy --wds-start-network="ip-type=4,apn=Wbdata" --client-no-release-cid (you must have an APN for your SIM card, mine was Wbdata for example)
Once you see "Network started", type the following: sudo udhcpc -q -f -n -i wwan0 (remember wwan0 was mine and is just an example)
After executing above command, an IP should be leased to you.
At this point, disconnect any external network connections (such as ethernet connections).
sudo nmcli d (the LTE card should now display as green and status type connected, should be only device listed assuming you disconnected any ethernet/wifi connections)
ping 8.8.8.8 (test that LTE is working)


Ubuntu Server 20.04
======================
Install 20.04 server
sudo apt update
sudo apt install net-tools
sudo apt install network-manager
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl start network-manager
sudo systemctl enable network-manager
sudo ls /etc/netplan
sudo vi /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
For each ethernet listed, add "optional: true" below each "dhcp4: true" line.
